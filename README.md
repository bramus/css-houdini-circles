#### Installing it Locally

You can install the `css-houdini-circles` locally using NPM.

npm install css-houdini-circles
```

Alternatively you can clone [the `css-houdini-circles` repo](https://github.com/bramus/css-houdini-circles/) and after manually build the project:

```bash
cd css-houdini-circles
npm install
npm run build
```

You'll find the built file in the `./dist` folder.

### 2. Loading `css-houdini-circles`

To include it you must loads the module in the given JavaScript file and add it to the Paint Worklet.

If you want to use the UNPKG hosted version of `css-houdini-circles`, use `https://unpkg.com/css-houdini-circles/dist/circles.js` as the `moduleURL`.

```js
if ("paintWorklet" in CSS) {
  CSS.paintWorklet.addModule(
    "https://unpkg.com/css-houdini-circles/dist/circles.js"
  );
}
```

```js
if ("paintWorklet" in CSS) {
  CSS.paintWorklet.addModule("url/to/circles.js");
}
```

#### A note on older browsers

To add support for [browsers that don't speak Houdini](https://ishoudinireadyyet.com/), you can include the [css-paint-polyfill](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/css-paint-polyfill) before loading the Worklet.

```html
<script>
  (async function () {
    if (CSS["paintWorklet"] === undefined) {
      await import("https://unpkg.com/css-paint-polyfill");
    }

    CSS.paintWorklet.addModule(
      "https://unpkg.com/css-houdini-circles/dist/circles.js"
    );
  })();
</script>
```

### 3. Applying `css-houdini-circles`

```css
.element {
  background-image: paint(circles);
}
```
